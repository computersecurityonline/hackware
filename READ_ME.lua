Hey!

My name is Andrew and I am a 14 year old ROBLOX developer who made this anti-cheat alone to hopefully keep your game safe from exploiters.

Features : 

- Auto-Updating 
Description : Whenever hackware updates, this page always updates and the script automatically updates.

- Instant Detection
Description : This can detect exploiters the second they execute something we can detect.

- Amazing Detection Methods
Description : We use detection methods to make sure we are updated with the latest security technology.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What it detects : 

- WalkSpeed changes 
Description : A WalkSpeed is the LocalPlayer (player)'s speed. It's always set to 16 and if it goes higher the player automatically gets 
kicked from the game due to exploiting.

- JumpPower changes
Description : A JumpPower is the LocalPlayer (player)'s JumpPower. It's always set to 50 and if it goes higher the player gets kicked.

- HipHeight changes
Description : HipHeight determines the distance (in studs) off the ground. Normally set to 2. If it goes higher than the player gets kicked.

- Teleporting
Description : Exploiters can teleport to locations if using a exploit. So here is a massive patch. There are over 5 checks currently.

- Flying 
Description : Exploits can fly in your game using basic scripts, so here is a patch. 2 are set.

- Anti-Asset Stealing
Description : This detects when a exploiter uses a common attack where he can open explorer GUIs where he can copy your whole game and view scripts. 
This is a small bypass for it
